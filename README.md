**Author**: Brady Camp
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

- This application is called City Explorer. It includes a search bar that allows the user to type in the name of a city and be displayed a variety of information pertaining to that city as well as a map. This will help users learn more about cities they wish to explore.

## Getting Started

- The first step was to create a very simple whiteboard drawing of what the web request-response cycle(WRRC) would look like.
- Then create a new react app from your local machine using the command `create react app city-explorer`.
- After that, create a repo in GitHub and link them together following the instructions on GitHub.
- This then imports all the files needed to get started.

## Architecture

- Whiteboard created using Miro.
- This application includes JSX, React Bootstrap, Axios library, and Location IQ Geocoding API
